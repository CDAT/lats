<P>

LATS is a library of software routines to output gridded data
developed by PCMDI in support of AMIP II and other
intercomparison projects.  The primary function of LATS is to
establish and implement a convention/standard for gridded data
and thus facilitate data handling and exchange.  The LATS
Application Programmer Interface (API) is designed to be simple
to understand and use. FORTRAN and C APIs are provided.

</P>

<P>

LATS applications output data in either the WMO "GRIdded Binary"
<A
HREF="http://dao.gsfc.nasa.gov/data_stuff/formatPages/GRIB.html">(GRIB)</A>
 format or in the <A
HREF="http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html">NetCDF</A>
format under the <A
HREF="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html">COARDS</A>
convention. <FONT COLOR="#000000">LATS-generated data written
according to the GRIB or COARDS conventions is readily accessible
by <A
HREF="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/williams/vcs/vcshome.html">VCS</A>,
<A HREF="http://grads.iges.org/grads/">GrADS</A> or <a
href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ktaylor/ezget/ezget.html">EzGET</A>.
&nbsp;A variety of other <a
href="http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/software.html">
software packages</a> recognize these conventions; and may also
be able to access, visualize and manipulate LATS-generated
data.</FONT>

</P>

<P>However, there are rather rigid constraints placed on the
structure of the data written with LATS, and thus in its current
form LATS should not considered as a general purpose gridded data
output routine.  These constraints are a consequence of the
following design criteria:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Simple to use</LI>

<LI>Multi-platform</LI>

<LI>Targeted for GCM output (currently limited to rectilinear data)</LI>

<LI>Implement and establish conventions for data and metadata</LI>

<H2><A NAME="basics"></A>Basic Features of LATS</H2>

<UL> <LI>LATS outputs rectilinear, gridded, spatio-temporal
data. The fundamental unit of data written with a single function
call is a horizontal longitude-latitude slice of a
variable. However, derivative structures such as zonal
mean-height cross sections (i.e., a sequence of single-longitude,
multiple-latitude grids) are supported. </LI>

<LI>LATS data written in either GRIB and/or netCDF are machine independent.
</LI>

<LI>LATS maintains an internal parameter table that prescribes
variable names, description, units, datatype, basic structure
(e.g., upper air or surface), and compression (GRIB options).
These descriptors are inferred from the parameter name only.
Thus, most of the metadata needed to write GRIB and/or netCDF
data are located in the parameter table to simplify the API.</LI>

<LI>An option is provided to override the internal table with an
external parameter file. LATS <a href="parmfile.html">parameter
tables</a> are designed to fit specific needs, such as those of
AMIP and CMIP.</LI>

<LI>More than one LATS file may be open simultaneously for output.</LI>

<LI>For a given timepoint, multiple variables and variables at
multiple levels may be written in any order.</LI>

<LI>Data can only be written in increasing time sequence.</LI>

<LI>All data are floating-point or integer. Only FORTRAN REALS (C floats)
and INTEGERS (C ints) can be written</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><i>Restrictions:</i></B></P>

<UL>
<LI>All variables written to a given file must share a common frequency
(e.g., hourly, daily, monthly, etc.).</LI>

<LI>All fields must be rectilinear gridded data (e.g., Gaussian grid data
is acceptable, but &quot;thinned&quot; Gaussian grid data - where the number
of longitude grid points is a function of latitude - is not). </LI>

<LI><font color="red"><b><i>All variables must be declared
(including all their dimensions and attributes)&nbsp; before
any numerical data is written</b></i></font> to a
LATS&nbsp;file.

<LI>All variables for a given time slice must be written before
proceeding to the next time slice</LI> </UL>

<H1>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H1>

<H2><A NAME="usage"></A>Usage</H2>

<P>The LATS API consists of eleven functions.  Detailed
information on each of these functions is contained in the <a
href="lats.html">man page</a>. An outline of a LATS program,
including reference to several LATS functions, is given
below:</P>

<DT>1. Specify an external <a href="parmfile.html">parameter
table file</a>, with <B>lats_parmtab</B>. <i><font
color="red">While optional, setting the table file in the
application will be required for AMIP II as updates to the tabel
and QC marks become available.</i></font></DT>

<DT>2. Define all grid(s), with <B>lats_grid</B>. </DT>

<DT>3. Define all vertical dimensions (e.g., pressure level) with
<B>lats_vert_dim</B>.  If a default surface dimension is defined
for a variable, it does not have to be redefined with
lats_vert_dim. Grids and vertical dimensions may be shared across
variables and files. NOTE: At present, only one grid may be
defined for a GrADS/GRIB file.</DT>

<DT>4. Create a LATS file, with <B>lats_create</B>.</DT>

<DT>5. For <font color="red"><i>each variable to be written to the file: Declare the variable
with <B>lats_var</B></i></font>. (Note: this is required even if the variable has
been declared for a different file)</DT>

<DT>If there is a missing data flag, define it with <B>lats_miss_float</B>
or <B>lats_miss_int</B>.</DT>

<DT>6. For each time-point, in increasing time order: For each horizontal
level of each variable: Write the data for this level, time-point, with
<B>lats_write</B>.</DT>

<DT>7. Close the file, with <B>lats_close</B>.</DT>

<br> It is possible to write structures other than fully 2-D
horizontal longitude-latitude grids.  For example, to write zonal
mean vs. height cross sections, the grid must be defined as
containing a single longtitude (a dummy value) in
<b>lats_grid</b>.  One latitude grid (a 1-D array) at each level
would be written with <b>lats_write</b>.
<br>

<p>

The <a href="#ftp_lats">LATS distribution</a> comes with a sample
<a href="testlats.f.html">FORTRAN code </a> and <a
href="README.test.html">detailed instructions</a> on creating
LATS applications.  This program is used to verify that LATS is
working properly on your system.  Furthermore, the distribution
is self contained, i.e., all materials needed for creating LATS
application are included, ranging from the libraries and
utilities to documentation on setup and application building.

<H2><A
NAME="guidelines"></A>Guidelines for AMIP II Users</H2>

<P>Although LATS was geared for AMIP II data, there are
additional guidelines that need to be followed by AMIP II
particpants.  These additional constraints will ensure even
greater data processing efficiency and more rapid data
distribution.</P>

<UL> <LI>Use only the LATS_COARDS or LATS_GRADS_GRIB conventions.
Data produced under conventions are guarenteed to be immediately
accesible to VCS/GrADS and EZGET -- the primary data interfaces
at PCMDI</LI>

<LI>Data must be written in increasing time sequence.</LI>

<LI>All data must be on the same grid (i.e., no staggered grid
data). Modeling groups participating in AMIP II should
interpolate all staggered grid variables to a single, common
grid. </LI>

<LI>For ALL data associated with intervals of time, such as
6-hour accumulations and averages set the valid time in
<b>lats_write</b> to the value at the beginning of the
interval.</LI>

<LI>Grid orientation: monotonically increasing in latitude and longitude,
<B>no wrap-around points</B> (e.g., 72 points , 0 to 355 degrees). </LI>
</UL>

<P>Beyond the above requirements, we recommend that:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Grid orientation: start at Greenwich meridian and south pole. </LI>

<LI>The time sequence of the simulation should be clearly
identified in the file name.</LI> </UL> </UL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H2><A NAME="formatchoice"></A>LATS convention and format options: the
pros and cons</H2>

<P>The two format options in LATS, <A
HREF="http://laraine.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">netCDF</A>
and <A
HREF="http://dao.gsfc.nasa.gov/data_stuff/formatPages/GRIB.html">GRIB</A>,
have distinctly different advantages.  AMIP II users are free to
choose the LATS format which is most appropriate for their needs
but are required to use either the LATS_COARDS or LATS_GRADS_GRIB
conventions listed below.  The LATS <I>Convention</I> defines how
the data and the metadata (data on the data) are structured as
well as the the actual file format.  It is the standards on
metadata and structure which makes LATS data accessible to a data
intreface.  Some factors to consider when choosing LATS
format/convention options are summarized below. Note that the
data format is implied by the convention. </P>

<P><B>Convention options: </B></P>

<P><B>LATS_PCMDI (netCDF)</B>: Permits the use of calendars other
than the standard Gregorian calendar. Other than the calendar
options, this option is at present consistent with the COARDS
conventions. Future releases may provide other extensions beyond
the COARDS convention. Files created with this convention may be
used with all netCDF utilities, except those that require the
COARDS convention (e.g., GrADS).  As this is an evolving
convention, its use in AMIP II is not supported.</P>

<P><B>LATS_COORDS (netCDF): </B>Compliant with the <A
HREF="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html">COORDS
metadata standard</A> . If this convention is chosen, the
calendar must be specified to be Gregorian (LATS_STANDARD
calendar). Internally, monthly data is represented in units of
&quot;days since (basetime)&quot;. Climatology data is assumed if
year = 2. Fixed fields (e.g., topography) is assigned the year
1.</P>

<P><B>LATS_GRADS_GRIB: </B>WMO GRIB format (GRIB), plus a GrADS
control file and a GRIB map file. Variables must be defined on
the same horizontal grid.  Supports, all calendar options except
Julian and 360-day years.</P>

<P><B>LATS_GRIB_ONLY: WMO GRIB only. </B>The delta may be
zero. This convention is the most general, but may not be readily
interfaced to VCS and GrADS.  Appropriate for straight data
transmission with no need for direct data interface.  </P>

<P><B>Data format pros and cons:</B></P>

<P><B>netCDF - advantages: </B>There is a wide range of <a
href="http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/software.html">tools</a>
available for netCDF data, and it is used extensively in the
atmospheric science reseach community, particularly among
universities. The netCDF metadata model is general and
flexible.</P>

<P><B>netCDF - disadvantages:</B> Requires installation and use
of the netCDF libraries. For some platforms, netCDF version 2.4
or greater must be used for performance reasons.  At present,
LATS does not support the COARDS data compression (offset plus
scaling to 16-bit integers) option, but will do so in a future
release.  Data writing and reading can be much slower than GRIB,
particularly for large grids (e.g.,360x180 points).  An analysis
of netCDF performance is underway, but preliminary results
indicate writing is around 30% slower and reading (using the
GrADS interface) up to 500% slower, depending on grid size.</P>

<P><B>GRIB - advantages: </B>GRIB is a WMO standard and is widely
used at most numerical weather prediction centers (e.g, ECMWF and
NCEP).  GRIB features flexible compression options on a
variable-by-variable basis and binary format is generally simple.
For AMIP II high frequency (6-h) data, GRIB files will be on
average 2.5 times smaller than netCDF format, i.e., a space
savings of ~60%.</P>

<P><B>GRIB - disadvantages: </B>GRIB is a primarily a physical
format with metadata defined for each 2-D grid (i.e., a GRIB
message) only.  Thus, GRIB data cannot be organized internally as
higher dimensional data sets.  The higher dimensional structure
achieved in the LATS_GRADS_GRIB convention is though a mapping
function not part of the format.  Beyond, the GrADS interface,
there is no standard programming interface and a variety of GRIB
'flavors' (LATS uses WMO GRIB Edition 1 and the NCEP standard)
have evolved complicating interface building.

<P>Consult the LATS man pages for a detailed description of the
LATS programming interface. </P>

<H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H2>

<H2><A NAME="details"></A>Design Constraints and Resulting
Limitations</H2>

<P>The LATS software library was designed with two overarching
constraints -- simplicity and two-format output. Supporting
output of both netCDF and GRIB from the same interface requires
limitation to a common denominto.  netCDF is a self describing,
data-set orientated (e.g., 4-D variables) format whereas GRIB is
only designed to output 2-D lon/lat grids.  The GrADS interface
allows GRIB data to be treated as if it where a data-set in the
netCDF sense (i.e, the netCDF 4-D "data model").  Thus, to
support the GrADS interface to GRIB and for consistency with
netCDF <b><i>LATS 1.0 requires all variables to be declared
(including all their dimensions and attributes), before any
numerical data are written</b></i>.  While netCDF does in fact
allow an application to define and write in any order, additional
functions would have to be added to LATS making the system more
complex.  Further, a relaxation of the define once, then write
constraint would allow for a greater range of data structures
(e.g, a set of time-series) and thus greater complexity in the
processing at PCMDI.  However, we expect to ease the define
once, write many restriction in future versions.

<P>Although four conventions may seem complex, it is symptomatic
of the great variation in existing data as conventions are often
specific to an individual.  The purpose of a convention is to
improve the efficiency of a group.  The lack of conventions for
AMIP I was very costly to PCMDI in that we had to bring the
disparate data sets (all 30 data sets were different) to some
common standard.  Compared to AMIP I, four conventions will
greatly improve the efficiency of PCMDI and our ability to
support analysis of the AMIP II results.</P>

<P>While the valid year of a climatology field may have no mean,
it is generally required by data interfaces.  LATS internally
sets a time convention for climatology and fixed fields.  Again,
there are no obvious standards for descripting the valid time of
climatology or fields such topography.  Thus, we have arbitraily
set the valid year of a data written under the climatolgy
calendars to the year 2 AD and fixed fields to 1 AD.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H2><A NAME="enhancements"></A>Planned enhancements</H2>

<P>In addition to formatting data, LATS provides some basic data
quality control facilities (not included in the table of the
current release).  Note also that the current release of LATS
requires the netCDF library, even for those users who only intend
to use the LATS_GRADS_GRIB convention.  The current version is
expected to be sufficient for use throughout AMIP II. Future
software modifications/enhancements will be fully backwards
compatible with the current version. Once the AMIP Panel has
completed <A
HREF="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2/temp/output/sampstudyprop.html">testing
compression of AMIP&nbsp;model output</A>, the LATS_GRADS_GRIB
compression will be determined for the high frequency (6 hourly)
output. This will not require obtaining an update to the
software, only the LATS parameter table. The current list of
planned enhancements is:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Predefined quality control values for the AMIP II Standard Model Output.
</LI>

<LI>Improved treatment for storage of latitude-height (e.g., zonal means)
fields. </LI>

<LI>Support for a richer set of grid types (zonal fields, thin grids, preprojected
grids, etc.).</LI>

<LI>Support for forecast data (e.g., NWP).</LI>

<LI>Port to MS-DOS / Win32 Operating Systems </LI>

<LI>Support COARDS compression for netCDF data.</LI> </UL>

<H2>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H2>

<P>The LATS 1.0 Distribution consists of the libraries (LATS and
netCDF), include files, documentation, sample code, and utilities
