# Quality control marks
#   (no limit on number of entries)
#
# The format of each record is:
#   variable | level_type | level | mean | std | tolerance | range | rangetol
#
# variable = variable name
# level_type = type of level, as defined in the leveltypes section, or blank if no associated level
# level = level value, or blank if no specified level
# mean = observed mean at specified level
# std = observed standard deviation at specified level
# tolerance = number of standard deviations about mean
#     (if abs(calculated_mean - mean) > (std * tolerance), flag the value as 'mean out of range')
# range = observed (maximum - minimum)
# rangetol = range tolerance:
#     (if calculated_range > (rangetol * range), flag as 'range is too large')
