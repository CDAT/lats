1.0	INTRODUCTION

In an attempt to define data standards/policy for PCMDI, I have
coordinated various variable parameters tables to establish a
first-guess "master."

The PCMDI data policy would require that ALL applications (e.g.,
LATS) and documents needing variable description would come from
the master.  Further, the master would be maintained by only one
person (i.e., myself).

The basic format is LATS-compatible and the tables contain more
information and details than would normally be needed by most
applications.  Additional fields and tables can be created as
appropriate.

To make the tables easier to use, I have created a few perl
scripts, specifically,

1)	sorting
2)	printing
3)	wgrib tables (the GRIB decoder/lister)
4)	amip2 variables only

and I will build other scripts as needed.


2.0	THE TABLES

Please see,

/pcmdi/typhoon_d0/lats/tables/

pcmdi.lats.parms.table.1.txt		PARAMETERS table
pcmdi.lats.vertdim.table.1.txt		vertical dimension descriptors

I use the term PARAMETER vice variable because, as defined in the
table, a parameter is a VARIABLE (a physical quantity) + LEVEL
descriptor.

For example,

ua	=	Atmospheric u component of the wind which may vary in the vertical
uas	=	ua at the sfc (10 m)	

The format for the parms table is:

NNN      PPP    DDD                UUU   TTT     VVV     DSF    BPGP   AAAA    GRIB1 

alb     |  84 | Albedo            | %   | float |       |  0   | -999 |      | g1 |

where

NNNN 	- 	PARAMETER name used in LATS
PPP	-	GRIB parameter number describing the VARIABLE 
DDD	-	Description
UUU	-	Units
TTT	-	Data type - int or float
VVV	-	Vertical dimension type
		  blank 	means the PARAMETER my vary in the vertical
		  nonblank	the PARAMETER is a "sfc" or associated with a single level
				e.g., sfc = surface of the earth the descriptor comes
				from the pcmdi.lats.vertdim.table.1.txt

DSF	-	GRIB decimal scale factor.  The GRIB coding process
		in this case works as follows:

		1)	subtract out the lowest value and store
		2) 	multiply resulting deviation from the min by 10^DSF
		3)	convert to integer by rounding (int(dev+0.5))
		4)	calculate the bits/grid point to represent the result range
		5)	code the integers (all positive) into the binary data section
			of the GRIB message

		In the case of alb the DSF is 0, or just convert the
		input array to integers and code.  This implies a
		numerical precision of +/- 0.5 %

		The DSFs conform the NCEP standard and are
		"aggressive" compression wise.  Most centers
		(e.g., NCEP and FNMOC) use DSF because it saves
		space and has constant precision.

		-999 means the data will be coded using a fixed
		number of bits per grid point 

BPGP	-	GRIB coding using fixed width or bits/grid point.
	
		For example, 12 would mean 12 bits/grid point or
		the data will be coded using integers 0 - 4095
		(2^12 -1).  The precision will be +/- 0.5*(min-max)/4095
		Thus, precision varies with the field and is not
		fixed as when using a DSF.  For BPGP = 16
		The precision would be (min-max)/65535 or about
		4.5 decimal places of precision IN THE DEVIATION
		FROM THE MIN VALUE which could be higher than the
		full value of the field.  For a typical global
		sea level pressure field, the min would be 960
		hPa and the Max 1040 hPa or +/- 0.0006 hPa of
		precision for BPGP = 16.  In contrast, for a DSF =
		-1 as in the NCEP standard, the precision would be
		+/- 5 Pa or +/- 0.05 hPa.
	
		-999 means decimal scaling will be used

		If DSF and BPGP are -999, the DSF=-999 and BPGP =
		16, which is the ECMWF standard.
	
AAAA	-	Optional field used in AMIP2 to indicate the table
		Not used by LATS

GRIB1	-	g1 in this field indicates a standard GRIB variable
		(PPP <= 127).
		Not used by LATS.
		

The format for the vertdim table is:

NNN        DDD                         UUU        TTT     DIR     G1    G2  G3   G4

plev	 | Pressure level	     | hPa	| multi  | down |  100 | 0 |  0 | 0
pbltop	 | Top of PBL       	     |		| single |   up	|   21 | 0 |  0 | 0

NNN	-	Name of the level
	
DDD	-	Description

UUU	-	Units if appropriate

TTT	-	single 	: 	a constant of "sfc" variable
		multi 	:	may vary 

DIR	-	Orientation relative to increasing index
		down 	: 	decreases with increasing index (e.g., pressure)
		up	: 	increases with increasing index (e.g., height)

G1-4	-	GRIB parameters for representing the level.


3.0	SUMMARY

As always, your comments are welcome.  While I support
flexibility in the standard, getting it right up front will make
working our data consistent and easier.  Perhaps more
importantly, I will be creating my observational data sets in
strict conformance to this standard.
