The LATS library 

| :warning: WARNING: Maintenance-only mode until around the end of 2023.          |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
The CDAT library is now in maintenance-only mode, with plans for deprecation and cease of support around the end of calendar year 2023. Until this time, the dependencies for specific CDAT packages (`cdms2`, `cdat_info`, `cdutil`, `cdtime`, `genutil`, `libcdms`) will be monitored to ensure they build and install in Conda environments. We currently support Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Unfortunately, feature requests and bug fixes will no longer be addressed.|

Introduction
------------

This directory contains the binary library, include files, and
documentation for the LATS I/O library, which is used to format data
for the PCMDI AMIP II experiment.

Documentation
-------------

The man page lats.3 documents the LATS application programming
interface. The man page lats.5 documents the parameter file syntax.

Platforms
---------

This release has been compiled under SunOS 4.1.3, SUN Solaris 5.4,
SGI/Irix 5.3, HP/HPUX 9.0, Cray/Unicos 8.0. DEC Alpha/Digital Unix V3.2,
and IBM RS6000/AIX V3.2.

Installing LATS
---------------

To install the LATS library:

   (1) Choose a root installation directory, <LATS>. The default is
       /usr/local. Type "make prefix=<LATS> install". This installs:

		   liblats.a in <LATS>/lib
		   lats.h and lats.inc in <LATS>/include
		   amip2.parms in <LATS>/lib/lats
		   lats.3 in <LATS>/man/man3
		   lats.5 in <LATS>/man/man5

Notes
-----

  Cray
  ----

       netCDF versions 2.4.X and greater contain optimizations for the Cray
       which can greatly enhance I/O performance, when using the
       LATS_PCMDI or LATS_COARDS convention.


  DEC Alpha/OSF
  -------------

       It is recommended that LATS be linked with netCDF version 2.4.X or
       greater under Alpha/OSF, when using the LATS_PCMDI or LATS_COARDS
       option. Prior to version 2.4, the typedef `nclong' was equated to
       `long'; subsequently it is equated to `int' on 64-bit
       platforms. Consequently, when linking with netCDF V2.4.X, LATS
       integer data should be ints, but with earlier versions, integer data
       should be longs.
